This is a repository for a game based on the
1994 Super Nintendo game *Aerobiz Supersonic*
by Koei Entertainment.  It is written in Python
using the SGE game engine based on PyGame.  SGE
can be found [here](http://stellarengine.nongnu.org/index.html).
  This is a work in progress, and very rough at
  this stage, so please be patient.

  **Dependencies**:
  >PyGame: http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml

  >SGE: http://stellarengine.nongnu.org/index.html

  >Six: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/six

  >Geopy: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/geopy

Once these are installed, you can run **python airline_simulator.py**
 and hopefully things should work.
